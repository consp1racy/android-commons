# commons-android
Collection of custom utilities for Android development.

If you find this library to your liking know this: It's mainly for use in my own projects. I maintain no changelog and anything can change at any time.

How to use:

    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/consp1racy/maven/' }
    }
        
    dependencies {
        compile 'net.xpece.android:commons:0.5.7'
    }
